# About Me

Iâ€™m a software developer from Germany.

My main areas of interest are frontend and backend web application development. As a frontend developer I focus on creating accessible interfaces using semantic HTML and CSS. I use TypeScript (or JavaScript) with Vue, React or Angular to create clean and maintainable web applications. For backend development, my focus is on Java (for example using Spring Boot) and Rust. I always enjoy learning new technologies, or sharing knowledge with my peers.
I use the pronouns _they/them_.
