# About Me

I’m a software developer from Germany.
My main areas of interest are frontend and backend web application development. As a frontend developer I focus on creating accessible interfaces using semantic HTML and CSS. I use TypeScript (or JavaScript) with Vue, React or Angular to create clean and maintainable web applications. For backend development, my focus is on Java (for example using Spring Boot). I always enjoy learning new technologies, or sharing knowledge with my peers.

I use the pronouns _they/them_ or _he/him_.
